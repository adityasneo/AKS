Nodes-Physical or Virtual
Deployment controllers:for rolling out and rolling back applications
service discovery and load balancing for exposing applications to the outside world
storage orchestration
self healing for automatically replacing and rescheduling failed containers

etcd- distributed key-value store: to maintain the state of k8s cluster and configuration
controller manager -- managing the various controllers like replication and self healing
API-Server -- exposing k8s API and interacting with etcd store
Scheduler-- create or scale app's the scheduler determines what  nodes can run workloads and starts them
kubelet -- communicating with APIS server and managing lifecycles of pods
container runtime -- pulling and starting containers on node
kube-proxy -- implementing service networking model
